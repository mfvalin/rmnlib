! modeled after MPI_Win_allocate_shared
! no MPI window id is returned
! no disp_unit is used
! no info is used
! size : used only by process with rank == 0, size shared memory segment in bytes
! base : type(C_PTR) is returned as in 2008 syntax instead of INTEGER(KIND=MPI_ADDRESS_KIND)
! comm, ierr : same as MPI_Win_allocate_shared
! It is the userâ€™s responsibility to ensure that the communicator comm represents a group of processes 
! that can create a shared memory segment that can be accessed by all processes in the group
! the allocation is handled in such a way that the shared memory segment
! will be automatically freed when the last process terminates
